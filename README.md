# Hey, I'm Sana 👋

I build AI products and ship production-ready systems that solve real business problems.

Most of my work bridges product strategy and technical execution: defining AI/ML roadmaps, architecting data pipelines, and deploying GenAI solutions that deliver measurable impact—$2M in cost savings, 45% fraud reduction, 70% workflow automation.

## What I Do

**AI Product Ownership**
- End-to-end AI product lifecycle: stakeholder discovery → requirements → MLOps deployment → governance
- Agentic AI systems with RAG, LangChain, and LLM embeddings for document processing automation
- Fraud detection frameworks using anomaly detection and ML-based scoring models
- Data product strategy across enterprise datasets serving 1200+ users

**Data Engineering & MLOps**
- Real-time Kafka streaming pipelines integrated with ELK stack
- Apache Airflow DAGs on GCP with automated ETL workflows (40% reduction in pipeline failures)
- Cloud migrations: on-prem Hadoop → GCP BigQuery with HIPAA compliance and PII masking
- SQL optimization across Oracle, Hive, Trino, Impala (70% faster execution times)

**Agile Delivery**
- PSPO II certified | Led 3 concurrent GenAI product squads with 94% sprint commitment rate
- Managed backlogs of 150+ user stories for AI/ML initiatives
- Product discovery through 30+ customer interviews translating to actionable requirements

## Current Focus

Building at the intersection of AI products and data engineering:
- Generative AI adoption strategies for enterprise workflows
- MLOps frameworks for fraud detection and anomaly systems
- Resource allocation and cloud optimization for FinOps teams
- AI-powered automation for document processing and ticketing systems
